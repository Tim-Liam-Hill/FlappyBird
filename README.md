### Description

A long time ago, I challenged myself to write flappy bird in a day. Using processing, I managed to achieve this goal. At the time, I was still new to programming and was not aware that I could save code to github. Consequently, I lost this code for a while but since I have recently managed to locate it again, I thought I would share what a far less experienced me was able to accomplish. 

This program is written in processing and will require the processing environement in order to be run. 

### Instructions

In order to run the program you will need to download the processing IDE from https://processing.org/. To play the game you will need only a spacebar. Your game is paused once you die and a new game restarts whenever you press any key on your keyboard.
